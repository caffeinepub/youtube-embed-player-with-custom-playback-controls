  "summary": "Implements the core single-page YouTube URL/videoId input + parsing + embed flow, and adds a custom-controls UI backed by a YouTube IFrame API hook with a dark theme. However, some control functionality is either explicitly left unwired (progress/seek bar) or cannot be confirmed due to truncation, and several unrequested/auth-related/backend pieces were added (including changes under paths called out as immutable in the BuildRequest constraints).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Custom controls should include seeking via the progress bar (or otherwise wire the displayed progress control to player seeking).",
      "reason": "The progress Slider’s onValueChange contains a comment indicating it is not wired to seekTo, so user-driven scrubbing via the progress bar is not implemented.",

      "reason": "A speed selector is implied by imports/props (Select + onPlaybackRateChange), but the relevant JSX/options wiring is truncated, so the required behavior cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
